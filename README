Please read this carefully. I will be adding more to this as I come up with new stuff.

Although I'm describing the classes in the folder please the RoR docs to see how the setters and getters are actually done. Along with the other methods.

RoR is a MVC framework meaning, you have models (in this case database schemas) and controllers thathold the methods and such. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND I WILL GO OVER IT IN MORE DEPTH

Willie - base you schema off these. In RoR it creates a table for each model (if you want). I'm sure there are other ways but that's how I've used it so far.
